*cold creek*

It's only natural for a good old country boy to get up to some antics once in a while. I'm no different than anyone else. I get the work done, and then I have some fun. I go looking for it, or it finds its way to me. Most of the time it's my brother's idea.

Our family works hard, long days on the farm. Our father works harder than anyone. At home, it's mind your work. At school, it's mind your lessons. On Sunday, Mom has us get up and dressed to hear the sermon at church, where it's mind your manners. Life is quiet as long as the rules are minded. But like I said, I struggle with that, only as much as any boy would.

Today at school it's near impossible to hear what's going on in the classroom over all the buzzing activity of springtime just outside the window. I watch a breeze move through a row of trees, bobbing the branches. Birds flutter around and reposition themselves among the green leaves. The tall grass of the fields is alive in a new way. It's waving to me, just to me. And a ladybug crawling along the windowsill, even this ladybug is letting me know it's better to be outside today than inside where the lesson drags on.

I turn my head to the front of the room. When I let out a sigh, Donny, my brother, meets my eyes from his seat just ahead of me. He shows me a piece of paper in his hand, folded up four times into a square. The teacher knocks her knuckles against the blackboard, and he turns back quickly. I keep my eyes forward while my mind continues to drift. I wonder what he wanted me to see on the square of paper.

Next thing I know, the folded paper is dropped onto my desk with a smirk from the girl seated to my right. Donny scribbled "top secret" over the front. I carefully pull it open to keep the noise down and avoid the teacher's notice. I read the message he left and look up to see him grinning back at me. I can't keep myself from grinning, too. He's got another scheme, and in silence, we agree.

He and I work quickly. Within a few moments, we've both been excused to use the washroom. We meet outside where two other boys from the class are waiting around.

"Fellas, who'd like to go for a swim?" Donny asks us. He puts the question like a challenge, and what he really wants to know is, are we brave enough to accept?

We look around at each other until we're all sharing the same mischievous smile.

"I think that'd be mighty fine," I say. Donny whacks me on the back and the other boys giggle.

He says, "I was hoping you'd say so."

Donny leads the way and we take off from the schoolyard, not looking back. Just like that, we fall into this plan together. A nervous sweat is starting down my neck. As long as we make it out of the opening and into the rows of trees that line the perimeter, we'll get away clean. It's possible we've already been found out, but I don't want to know if we have. I want to swim. I want to feel the sunshine on my face. I want to sink my feet into the mud. It's glorious to be on my way.

We keep up a brisk pace around the trees and then it's a few more yards down the hill where the creek bed gurgles. At this spot, the creek's been dammed up to make a swimming hole. Dozens of songbirds screech noisily around us since we're disturbing their afternoon wash. The boy who reaches the bottom first sheds his clothes and splashes in. I am hollering and huffing after him while the others do the same. In the blink of an eye, four boys who are supposed to be in school are dunking each other in the creek.

I take my turn at the rope swing. Its gnarled knots are rough in my hands. When the last boy to go has cleared the way, I wind up with a few steps backward and leap from the ground. My hands lose touch with the rope. For a moment I am in the air. I am flying over the other boys and the water beneath me. I plunge into the sparkling creek. It's fantastic. My head pops up out of the water almost immediately, my arms make circles at my sides.

The four of us laugh and carry on for a while. Donny decides for us that we should go back to school just for the end of it. He's sure we can get by with an excuse for the time we've been gone. We make our way back, dripping creek water from our clothes. I stay back at the tree line waiting while they go inside one at a time. When it's clear, I break away from my hiding place and hope that the other boys made it inside without being caught. I hope with all hope, I'm happy from my afternoon adventure, and I'm finally dry. It is smooth sailing from here, just another hour or so in the classroom just like any other day, as long as the other boys don't blow it all. Gee, I hope they made it.

I stroll up to the school building. It seems like it's a world away from the creek. Every kid inside must be jealous up to their necks of us. They'll ask me how I did it. They'll probably want me to take them to the creek next week. And then I'll have to keep up this secret operation, maybe I'll charge a quarter for my troubles.

I open the door and rush inside. It is quiet. I try to stop my heavy breathing. I make the softest steps across the creaky wooden floor. One step, two steps, creeping closer to the classroom door. My heart is going faster than it has all day. Then I see them, circling around the principal right there in the hall, and my heart stops still.

My pals look up, dread and disappointment is masked over the rambunctious glow of afternoon sun on their faces. They hang their heads low, and I know that the fun is over.

"Leon," the principal calls, "I need to speak with you."

It's a long walk to the office. I want to stop and ask each of them what happened. I am dying to know how we got here, but there's no use. I wonder if the other boys will try to give excuses or not. I try to think of one, was I called home for a moment for something really important? But what? Maybe I'll say I got sick all of a sudden, but what if another boy says that? A lump is growing in my throat and my fingers stick together with nervous sweat.

There's no time to give an excuse, we shamefully enter the office and just as soon, we're out again. The principal says he trusts we had a good time swimming, but we must go to class to finish the day at school. He says he will speak to our parents, and that's the worst news of all. It puts a churning in my stomach that doesn't quit for the rest of the day. My eyes swing over to Donny, his face is pale and he's just as worried as I am. We were discovered for our absence, but I can't figure out who could have known we were at the creek.

I get back to my seat in the same old classroom. It's just as horrible as it was this morning. The teacher acknowledges us with a nod and continues the lesson. She looks extra stern. I dare not say a word to anyone. I cannot think of what my father will say, I cannot bear the agony of that confrontation when we get home. Dad will get the truth out of us, he always does. And when that happens, he'll make sure we get a good spanking that will keep any idea of skipping school out of our heads for a lifetime. Now the teacher is my one hope. I concentrate hard on her mouth moving to try to will her to keep teaching forever. If she would just go on and on like she does, I won't go home. But time won't stop for no one. I feel every second before it slips away and brings me closer to the final hour, the final minute, the final second. And then, it's another long walk home.

"You are dismissed," the teacher says.

I catch up to Donny at the door, and we march ourselves down the hall, not saying anything. Outside in the schoolyard, we see a group of girls gathered around, giggling behind their hands with their eyes on us. It is the very last thing I would like to see right now, I know immediately it's the bad kind of attention from the girls. Donny knows it, too. He starts walking faster to get around them. Then we hear, clear as day, from somewhere within the group, "and they didn't have any clothes on!"

Donny stops dead, his face flushes red. "What are you going on about?" He demands.

"We saw you at the creek!" The girls shriek with laughter at this announcement.

I look at Donny, he looks at me. I can't stand it any longer, I break off at a run. They must have followed, they must have known! They knew all along, they were there?! They saw us! They told on us! Anger, confusion and embarrassment like I haven't felt before fuels my escape from the schoolyard. My bare feet pound into the dirt. I don't stop running until I see our house.

Bent over with my hands on my knees, I gulp the air back into my lungs. I look at the dirt on the ground where a few ants crawl. I think how these ants don't have a father. They don't have a school. Heck, they don't even need clothes. They must be doing much better than me. I wish I could be an ant in the dirt, I feel just as low. I look back to see the others coming home from school. Donny is with them. He sees me and runs up.

"Donny, let's just have the truth out and get it over with," I call to him. I'm still panting a bit, but my mind is made up.

He says, "Everybody knows it. I bet dad knows it by now, too." He sighs. "I'm sorry, I didn't know the girls would follow like that. I just can't imagine it. They told everybody about it. And you know what? They were hiding in the bushes. I mean, can you just imagine?" He shakes his head.

"I don't care. Now let's just get inside and get it over with, okay?"

"Are you angry? Now don't be hard on me. I couldn't have known nothing that you didn't know!"

My ears are blazing. Arguing is the very last thing I'd like to do. I don't want the details either. I know it's Donny's fault for passing a note around the classroom, but it's not something I want to talk about. We're both in it just the same. And I can't wait another moment. I just want to have it out. Over and done.

I breathe out long and hard. I say, "I'm not angry with you." I turn and head up to the house. Mom is on the porch waiting up for us, she always is. When I reach her, she says, "Go see your father in the yard." My belly is churning worse than ever. I don't waste any time, and Donny is following close by. Behind the house, dad is waiting.

He has his arms crossed over his chest. His nose tips down at us. I'd learned that, with dad, you keep your words brief and you hurry them along.

"Dad, we got into some mess today at school," I say. He grunts. He turns his eyes on Donny. Donny's got his head hung low, he won't look up. I stick my elbow in his ribs. That gets his head up.

"Dad, I'm sorry. I took us away from school today. We missed an hour of our lesson. But I promise, we got all the good hours," Donny pleads.

"I wish you wouldn't have done that," Dad growls. "What was it you got up to?"

"Swimming at the creek," Donny answers.

Here it comes, the worst part of all. Dad does not speak or move or gesture or communicate one single thing more for a while. At his full height above us, with a stern look masking all his features, he thinks about what should be done. A silent giant determines our fate. I wiggle and Donny squirms as we wait.

After several long moments, his speech begins, the words come out like soldiers falling in line. "You boys have disappointed us at school. You know we send you there on purpose, so that you can learn something, so that you can keep some knowledge in your heads and do something with it. You'll learn nothing if you play at these schemes and tricks, going off to have your fun on school time. And it may have been fun for a time out there in the creek this afternoon, but here we are discussing and it's not so much fun now." He pauses. He resets his shoulders. His eyes stay on us. "Since this happened at school, it seems to me like this a problem for your principal to handle. While you're there taking his lessons, you're under his authority, is that right?"

We say, "Yes sir."

"So we'll have you tell us who you think should take care of this situation. Should I send you back to your principal in the morning, or should we have it settled here at home?"

My eyes went wide. I tried to think fast. Surely we'd like the principal's punishment better than we'd like our dad's belt to come down on us. I tried to figure out if Donny thought the same way. His expression hadn't changed, he was pale as ever. He might not be thinking at all. It was too much. We were on top of the world when we were boys skipping school, splashing around in the creek with the sun shining down and the rope swing making us fly. In a day, we'd been heroes turned to rascals. It seemed to happen so quickly. And now we'd been given a choice. Could it be true? Can he really mean he won't punish us tonight? I have to think.

"Well, Leon? Do you have your mind made up?" Dad asks.

"I think we should go back to the principal and apologize. After that, it's up to him," I reply. I give him no reason to doubt my confidence in my choice.

"So it's back to the principal. First thing you do when you get to the school, you go to the office. Donny, what do you say?"

Donny's shoulders are perking up. He looks dad in the eyes for the first time. He says, "I think he's right. I think I should apologize at school."

"Be sure that you do," Dad's strong voice completes the agreement. "Get inside now. Wash yourselves, you smell like the creek."

We're already running. We run into the house chasing after each other. We feel like we've got new lives. We wear big grins on our faces. It's incredible to be out from underneath the threat of a sore behind. I follow Donny through the house and we finally stop to catch our breath outside.

"What do you say? Huh? What do you say, Donny!" I scream at him.

"I say, that's the best whooping we never got!" We squeal and laugh. We leap with our legs and swing our arms up over our heads.

*Navy days*

I know it this morning better than I have known it since the beginning of all this: a sailor’s life is not the life for me. This stretch of countless days on the endless ocean stopped and started by unknown missions in godless places, it’s no good for a country boy. Problem is my home is so far away I hardly remember the kind of life that is for me. Still, even if I were to remember it crystal clear, it’s not there anymore at all. I was the last of us to leave it behind to go to war.

I let out a quiet sigh. I tie up my boots.

Looking around me at the other men, I see that I’m not the only one counting my regrets and sorrows this morning. There’s a melancholy thick as fog in the air. It happens like this anytime we spend an evening on the island. We go out and we just get carried away, it’s like something else takes us over. I’ll never speak a word of it, I swear. I know it’s just like a sailor to think and dream of home only when he’s done all he could to shame it. Well, we leave it behind us anyway. We’re off again this morning, back on the ancient, distant sea.

Navy isn’t so bad, I should say. I have a bed every night. I’m fed and clothed. My job is meticulous but it’s not dangerous. I have an assignment as electrician’s mate, so I maintain the function and repair of the ship’s electrical equipment, the batteries and generators below deck. I am rarely called to action, except to keep up with daily operations, and this next stretch of time on the water should be routine. Although last night on the island, among the waves of our merriment, word got around about mixed signals, misguided leaders, and foreshadowed storms. I didn’t waste my time thinking much of that. It’s just like a sailor to pass the night with legend and lore.

A fella smelling of smoke bumps into my shoulder as we stumble up the ramp onto the ship. He looks up at me since I’m rather taller than him and there’s a glaze over his eyes, and he’s mumbling something low and slow as if there were rocks tumbling around in his mouth. I recognize that he was one of those men giving warnings last night through a cloud of smoke. His pupils are small specks between the thin slits of his eyelids. We both take in a breath, sharing a cold stare. Just off instinct, I know I should not raise the matter of being bumped into with him, even though there’s an instant quickening of my blood when a man disrespects me. I’ve learned by my busted knuckles how to tamp it down. I stand still; he moves on.

I find that the more I get to know the men in my ranks, the more unpredictable they become. Fights among us aren’t uncommon, and the officers seem to encourage it. I heard one say it was good that we sort out our differences before we’re in real danger. That must be why some of these guys will throw me into a rage on purpose. Honest, I can’t understand why I get it so often. Like this man bumping my shoulder, I don’t know if I’ll truly let go of that. It’ll hang onto me for a while; anger is my silent traveler. But there’s good men, too. If there weren’t any men better than me, we would never get this ship anywhere, we would just be throwing ourselves around having fits of all kinds. This one man in particular, I can’t understand him at all. We will settle down to eat our meals, and there he is turning thanks, praying over his food. Every time. I see him at his bunk and he’s got a Bible open on his lap, not giving his attention to anything but this book in front of him. My mother would admire that, she wanted me to be that way. I guess he must be a true Christian man.

Back in the engine control room again. There are meters and lights to read and interpret. There are large batteries to move in and out. Myself and the other men carry out the maintenance required. All the small intricacies of electrical work command the attention of my fingertips, but my mind drifts like the ship from the shore.

After long hours at work, night closes in around us. The waves rise and fall without rhythm, without input from celestial light to make sense of them. The sailors collect in the mess hall after finishing our duties, sensing in the wind that there’s a storm upon us. Suddenly there’s a big drop. I stick my arms out to stable myself, my stomach flips. A few who are tasked with securing the deck are talking hurriedly and their eyebrows lace together and droop over their noses. We are onboard the destroyer equipped with missiles on the deck. If the ship were to take a roll from the tossing waves that would equal up to 50 degrees in slope, those guns are meant to detach from the deck and disappear into the sea, giving the ship the advantage of correcting itself upright without the extra weight. I get the sense from the tension in the room that these sailors aren’t discussing mathematical probabilities, but rather horrific imaginations. It’s now I realize this storm is the worst we’ve been up against.

In the faces of the men who pass me in the halls, I see something I haven't seen before. There's something new, something solemn. The ship rocks. I snap into action. I rush with a few others to the engine room. Everyone is rushing. Water is rushing over us. In the engine room, water is rushing. I see lights blinking. I see sparks flying. And then, I see nothing. Light vanishes, the rocking continues. My chest is all of a sudden flooded with a sobering coolness.

“Where is the generator?” A commander snaps. “Where is the backup power?”

Everyday I’ve wasted on this ship has been devoted to preparing the backup power for the eventual and unpredictable moment that the electrical power ceases. That moment arrives, the power fails, and we’re sinking. This reality hits each of us, I mean, we know we’re sinking. We know it’s over. The water keeps rising. The waves throw us around. It’s a dark, dangerous moment. Desperation speaks the same language as the Christian man every night in his bunk; each of us begins to pray. It’s a strange sound, it’s something that will stick with me forever if I make it out, the sound of these sailors praying. The darkness of the night stretches on.

Relief comes with the morning light, now the winds have backed off. The storm has passed us and we’re still here. I go up to the deck with a few men to see what the damage has been, to let the light of a day make us new. We took a shock with this storm. Each of us went through our worst fears and thought about them all night, but when we saw the deck this morning, completely cleared of all equipment, we were shocked all over again. The ship took a beating from the sea, and nothing was left to show for it, except the unreasonable fact that we’re still on it above the waves. Silently, we look around at each other and take in the emptiness.

I’ve talked it over with plenty of the guys. We can’t help but talk about the storm day and night. We ask ourselves what would have happened, what could have happened if we sunk. If we sunk to the bottom of the ocean like we should have done, what would become of us, where would we end up? We all prayed together in our hour of need, why only then? How could we have any hope that God would hear us? We got the power back on for the ship. We continue our journey as if it never happened. We’ll be in Hong Kong soon. But I just can’t forget it. I know the answer to the question. I know God wouldn’t hear my prayer, I’m afraid. And yet, I’m alive. It seems as though He did.
