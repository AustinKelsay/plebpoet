**Leon**

*changes*

A new office building going up on 63rd street contracted us to do the electrical work. Donny and I agree, it is the biggest project we’ve taken on yet. A nice thing about the job is when it comes time to wire a new site, all the other construction has to stop. It makes for a quiet work space, and I’m thankful for peace today. Even Donny is out for the day, so here I am working alone in this dark, empty space.

I don’t get this way too often, but I’m a little worried for myself. Since I’ve come back home, everything has changed so rapidly. I live in Oklahoma City. I attend church with Donny. A family that I knew from Stuart is kind enough to house me. So I don’t worry for my basic needs, I can provide for myself, which is more than can be said for many of the guys I knew on the ship. I worry about the future, mostly. I don’t know what I’m gonna make of my life, and I’m not convinced that I’m doing the right thing. I’m lost trying to figure out what the right thing would be. I hope it jumps out at me soon, kinda like the other things in my life have done.

I could only think about baseball before. Sports consumed my life. I started to play as a kid only because there was nothing else to do. I picked up the only glove I found in the school’s equipment bag because I knew mom and dad couldn’t buy me one. Just like that, I’m the catcher, and then it took off. I was locked in the game. The tiniest movement on the field was in my focus, and that’s how I could be so good at it, I didn’t miss anything. You didn’t want to lose to me, that’s for sure. I could be nasty about it. When I was in school, I couldn’t give my attention to the lessons at all, playing ball was too important, and it’s showing up now. The way I didn’t listen to anyone, I just wanted to get in the game, and they needed me in the game. Well, not anymore.

No other sounds in this building to interrupt my thoughts. I work slowly at connecting the wires.

---

The ball game is over, and the team crowds around to talk before heading home. The sun is sinking in the summer sky. It’s the church softball league I’ve been invited to play for, and we just earned our second victory since I’ve joined. A few guys slap their hands on my back in the huddle we’ve created.

“Leon, it’s good to have you on the team, you’ll be at service in the morning?” The elder who acts as the coach asks me.

I shrug and say, “Well, I suppose so, since we won our game.”

He nods. He doesn’t catch onto the joke I’m making.

The team plays Saturday nights, matched up with other churches from Bethany or northern Oklahoma City. We practice on Wednesdays. It’s different being around this group of men and women. I get the feeling when they pray, they mean it. There’s a genuineness about the things of God that I only remember seeing once before from one young man in the Navy. Before every game and every practice, we huddle and pray. Setting the tone like that for a softball game is also different for me. I think it might be what’s keeping me from blowing my temper as often as I used to. I’m just glad I haven’t been asked to lead a prayer yet.

A few yards from us, there’s a group of women from the church who watched the game and now stand around discussing whatever ladies discuss. I have met only a few of them. I really honestly try not to stare in their direction.

I notice gradually the two crowds of men and women coming together around me, breaking up into small conversations between groups. Phil, who plays outfielder, asks Susan about what she’ll prepare for a potluck coming up. That’s something I really treasure about these church people, they eat together often, and they eat together well. Rick and Tim sing in the choir with a few of the women, they chat about their next performance. The coach calls out to the crowd, “Well, it’s time for me to get my kids into bed, we’ll see you all tomorrow, goodnight!” And the crowd chirps back a series of phrases that communicate the same thing: “Goodnight, Bye bye, see you tomorrow!” His departure prompts a few others to find their way home for the evening.

It’s just at the moment that I’ve turned away to leave that I hear from behind me, “Leon!”

So just as soon, I twist back around, and there’s a group of women who have turned their eyes on me. Their eyes have a mischievous sort of glimmer. I step toward them, and they step toward me, altogether as if they are one.

“Leon, we wanted to ask you a favor. See, we know that you live in Warr Acres, isn’t that right?”

I reply, “Sure do.” I join my hands together behind my back, and shuffle my feet a bit.

“Well, you see, Janis lives there, too. We thought you could take her home and that would save us a trip.”

Another woman from the group adds, “A trip to Warr Acres, since you live there,” and then ducks her head down.

I know Janis. I had the pleasure of introducing myself previously in church. She is the piano player. She has stayed quite still among the women in the group. I consider what they’ve asked.

I say, “Janis, would you like for me to take you home?” I look right at her, as if the others aren’t there. She gives me the wonderful pleasure of returning my look, with a shy smile, and responds in her soft voice, “Yes, that’s all right.”

We’re back to work at the site for the new office building. Donny just returned from a trip to see mom and dad in Stuart. While we work, he tells me how dad has got things running on the farm.

“It’s getting out of his control. It seems like he knows it is, but of course, he’s not admitting that any time soon.” Donny coughs. He wipes his hands on his jeans, and looks up at me. “Did you hear about his accident?”

“What’s that?” I start listening a little better, my hands operating the wire tools up in the ceiling.

“Well, so you know that old threshing machine, it always acted up. You know that, and I know that. And dad, he just keeps on using it without anyone to do the raking, you know, like we did. That’s just dangerous, I might even say reckless.”

“You say something happened to him?”

“Oh yes, terrible.” Donny pauses. He lifts his arm and shows it to me, pointing to a spot beneath his elbow and moving his finger down to his wrist. He says, “From here to here, he’ll never be the same. It got caught up in the machine.”

“Ohh my.”

Donny shakes his head. “It’s tough to look at, I’ll tell you that. Skins all twisted and misshapen, still pretty badly bruised, but he keeps it wrapped up.”

“Wow, that must have hurt.” I rub my hand over my wrist, where it’s sensitive all of a sudden. He steps away to grab a tool from the truck.

I stand there alone and wonder if my parents are going to be all right, wonder if they need me. If my dad keeps on working like he’s used to, sooner or later, he’ll work himself into a grave. Then what? I’m wondering if my dad needs Jesus. God can save my dad, like he’s saved me.

My life is different now. I prayed with the pastor in his office at the church about a week ago, and that’s where I declared that my life will be different from now on. I do not have the shame or the fear that I once had. I do not live for myself, like I once did. And all this and so much more is changing in me. I wonder if my dad, well, I hope my dad could feel the same.

Donny comes back into the room we’ve been working in, and he stops when he sees the look on my face.

“What’s the matter?”

A few tears drop from my eyes. I take the rag from my pocket and quickly wipe my face. I say, “Oh, excuse me.” I sniff. “I just get to thinking about salvation so much lately.”

Donny steps across the room to me and places his hand on my shoulder. He smiles, but he doesn’t say anything more. Brothers don’t always need words.

Janis sits next to me for prayer meeting tonight. She helps me stay focused because I know she’ll ask me what I prayed about at the end. I feel like all I do is pray. My mind returns to rejoicing and blessing and requesting strength from God without me really being aware of it all day long. On the way to prayer meeting tonight, I prayed. I knew I would see Janis, and I prayed that God would make me the man for her. When I see her, I pray for her. When I think of her, I pray for her. She’s sitting here next to me, her eyes closed tightly and her hands opened toward heaven, and I greatly admire her.

After some time in silence, one of the church leaders stands to address the group. He runs through a list of members who we’ve been continually praying for as they face some difficult obstacle in their lives so that we may cheer them on or grieve with them. It’s these kind of things that I didn’t know would happen in the church. I never realized a church could be a family. When we face sickness or trial, loss or hopelessness, we do not face these alone. And this is what returns my heart and my mind to constant rejoicing, that I have found such a blessing and been so loved and accepted, and I will not face life alone because God has provided His people to walk with me. The list that he reads from includes everyone from new little babies to elderly home-bound members, showing me that throughout all the changes of life, there is this pillar to lean on.

He continues the meeting with a call to the altar. He welcomes anyone in need of healing to come kneel at the front and present their earnest request to God. A few people get up from their seat and take a place, bending their knees, bowing their heads. The leader calls again to the rest of us still seated, asking that we join our brothers and sisters in prayer. Janis is up from her seat and walks directly to a young woman who has knelt to pray. She places her hand on the woman’s back, closes her eyes and lifts up her head. I stay seated, watching her. Again, her eyes squint shut, and her lips move slightly, a few words escaping in a whisper. These are my favorite moments in the church. They are undeniably powerful.

Before the meeting is concluded, the leader stands once more and leads the group in a final prayer. A few people give a strong, “Amen,” in response. The people trickle out of the room. I keep my seat until Janis departs from the young woman, after they stand together and talk for a few minutes. She finds me and we leave together.

It’s Monday morning, a cold one. I lift my stiffened fingers up to my face and blow my breath over them as I arrive at the house I’ve been called to repair. The brick houses in this neighborhood are some of the oldest in the city. That can make them an electrical challenge. I park my truck, grab my tools, and size up the job ahead of me. It’ll be a long day.

It’s the stillness this morning that has my mind return to holy things. I almost can’t think over the fullness in my heart that has come over me. It seems to happen more and more. I whisper a prayer as I move through the quiet house.

I thought I would stumble into my life. I thought it would just sorta happen to me. It’s how I became the person I was, it was just what was around me. But it’s changed now, I’m changed. I have a different sense about life, almost like I have something to do with it. I blink at the electrical box now in front of me, trying to memorize it.

What a life I have in front of me. I have to be good, because I can ruin it easily. I’m redeemed from the old life, and the new life is up to me. That’s what fills my heart, to think of all the possibilities of my new life, to think of God leading me. Will I be an electrician in my new life? I identify the wiring problem after a few minutes looking around.

It’s just like the man said yesterday in church, “Every man and woman answers the call according to their gifts from God.” I do believe that. Janis has her gift of music that she shares, playing the songs and teaching the young ones. She liked what the preacher had to say. At the end of the service, he said something like, “if any of y'all feel like God’s calling you, would you come forward and let us have prayer with you.” And Janis, seated beside me, said, “Let’s go up there.”

So that’s what we did. I knelt there and prayed. The moment plays back in my mind as if it’s happening right in front of me, and I stop just short of stepping up onto my ladder.

I have made God the Lord of my life. He led me to Janis, to make her my wife. I don’t think he’s done leading me yet. I’m starting to realize what I did at that service, saying yes, and this fullness in my heart. . .it’s overwhelming. I have this urgency to respond, like God is here. My voice rings through the quiet house, “Yes Lord! I am willing!” And tears begin to fall from my eyes. My breath is pushing quicker through my lips. “Praise God! Let it be in me!” I am making my commitment right here. I pledge my life. I want the life that God has for me, I want to fulfill His call to the ministry.

After a few moments in prayer and adoration, in worship, I wipe at my face and look around me. It’s as if there is new color in all of it. Everything is the same, I’m standing in this unfamiliar house just as I was moments ago, but now it’s alive. I pick up my tools and step up to the ladder again. This is today’s job, but this is not what God has for me. I complete my task quickly, pack up and head home.

Janis is there. She has been putting things together for us in our new home. I can’t imagine what I’d do without her. As soon as I can, I tell her everything as it happened. I tell her about the commitment I’ve made. God bless that woman, she lights up. She accepts it and makes it her commitment, too. As we sit at the table, I take her hand and pray for us. I give thanks for the blessing of our marriage, and the future God has for us. Janis opens her eyes and looks to me. Just as simply as she accepts me, she guides me. She says, “Well, you need to go to college.”

This Sunday morning, I am renewed in my faith just by showing up to church. And at the same time, I am burdened. The message we heard this morning was about reaching others to tell them about new life in Christ. At the end, the preacher called for anyone to come kneel and pray about it, and I went. I was thinking of my dad. And I still am. The desire to go to him and talk with him is pressing on my heart. I can’t help but think that if I don’t go, he will never be saved. That’s why Janis and I are on our way to Stuart this afternoon.

I never had a difficult relationship with dad. Growing up, he was so serious, I just stayed out of his way and did what I was told. Now I’m older, I can see how he cared for us in what he did. He always made sure we were at church, but he never went in himself. The farmers stayed outside and talked. I haven’t heard him speak to his faith, whether it was there or not, but of course, I wasn’t thinking about it before.

I admit, I’m nervous to bring up the topic with him. I just have this feeling about it, but I worry I’m making a fool of myself, driving all the way just for a conversation he could easily reject. And what will he say? What will I say?

We pull up to the house. Before I can even take it in, there’s mom bursting out the door to greet us, just like she always, always did. She rushes to us, worried that our sudden visit means something terrible. Then dad steps out and all I can think to say is, “I need to talk to you.”

Inside with everyone seated at the table, I have a calm come over me, and I know that it’s the right time. I know I’m doing right. I tell dad about what the preacher said this morning, about the new life that Jesus gives to anyone who freely accepts it. And I’m not stumbling over it, I deliver it just as it was meant to be. I tell dad about my new life. I tell him, “I felt like God wanted me to come talk to you.”

When I finish, dad begins to tell me a story in return. He says, “I think you know it’s been hard for me trying to keep things running. Well, maybe I have been careless, or I don’t know what. But it’s amazing that you’ve come today because, just last week, I was hauling the tractor over the bridge in the back pasture. You know, that old, old wooden bridge. I just couldn’t explain to you how it happened, but one moment I’m driving it, the next, I’m pinned underneath it in the ditch. I had the struggle of my life crawling out from there. And amazingly, nothing broken, no damage to me or the machine, but I had a dose of reality, you might say. I had to sit there for quite awhile and wait for someone to come by and help me get home. While I sat, I just thought what could have happened. If the same thing had taken place with a different outcome, if I had been killed, what then?”

He pauses, looking down at his hands. “I know I wouldn’t…” He clears his throat. He looks up and I see something in his face I haven’t seen before, and I can’t believe he’s open to talking like this. He shifts in his chair a bit and then he asks, “Son, how can I be saved? And know that it’s real?”

Talk about the right time. My dad and I talked for a couple hours at the table. He had questions, and I tried to answer them, mostly from my own experience. We called the pastor from Stuart to give more clarity to this eventful conversation, and he came right away. He asked dad to give a testimony to the whole congregation, and I can’t believe it, he agreed. He’ll be standing up in front of the church people he’s known all his life in Stuart, and he’ll tell them he’s made a change. I am leaving the house today knowing that my dad has made a change.

*game day*

The Sooners did not play well last night. The starter group, in my opinion, is too young and full of themselves. They know they’ve got the talent, but they don’t play to the point of getting worn out enough to sit out, they play to look good. And they play the whole game sloppy, without giving anyone else a chance. I just plain don’t like how they played.

I look up at my reflection in the mirror and notice I’m muttering to myself. I push the comb through my hair once more, fasten my tie. I replace the bandage over my eye, and step out of the bathroom.

I call out through the house, “Janis, are you about ready?” and then here she comes, around the corner, her purse in hand. She’s ready. A step behind her, the top of her head just touching her mother’s shoulder, Cheryl insists she’s ready, too, and pokes her thumb back at her sister. She says, “Carol needed some help with the sash.” And here’s Carol, her arms crossed over her dress, squashing the bow tied at her waist.

“Okay now, let’s get going.” I hurry across the room, the girls follow, and we load up into the car to go to church.

This morning I’ll be sharing a message at a church in Oklahoma City. The good preacher there is retiring, and they want me to preach in the interim. I know the men of the church from playing golf with them last year. But then my accident happened, I released my swing and my golf ball struck a rock just in front of me and shot up into my eye, shattering my glasses. I’ve been in Oklahoma City frequently since then for eye surgeries instead of golf games. But it’ll be good to be with the church people, and I hope they do not mind a preacher with a patch over his face.

It’s early when we arrive. The girls head off to their Sunday school class and leave me to sit quietly in the church office. The hour before service begins is important to a pastor. It helps me after a long week of preparing to pray over my message. I read through the notes I’ve made, and I talk it over with God. Sometimes I will make changes or add something in. It’s this focus I need to get properly aligned to what God has for me to say. I’ve learned that with the practice I’ve had for these ten years since I preached my first, it comes more naturally now to be still in prayer. And I have come to believe that as long as my preparations are pure and my mind is empty of my own problems and things going on, that God will come alongside and direct me. He really will. The message I have today is one that I’m excited to bring to the attention of God’s people, and so it is my prayer, too, that they will be restored and find hope and comfort in the words I have to share.

Sitting up at the front of the sanctuary with my notes and my black leather-bound Bible on my knee, I join my voice with the congregation to lift up praises to heaven in song at the start of the service. My beautiful family fills in the space next to me, singing with almost angelic voices. Once again, I’m reminded, this is right. This is just exactly where I ought to be.

The music leader completes the song and gives an introduction for me, then I take my place behind the pulpit. I smile out at the people who have gathered this morning, shuffle my pages around, open my Bible, and begin.

*I have some exciting news to share with you this morning. You are invited to a party, a celebration. It’s one party I think you will enjoy. Everyone you have ever held dear is going to be there. Your mother, your dad, the grandmother you never got to know. Everyone whose life you admired will be in attendance with you.*

*I think you’ve caught on, we’re talking about the party of the kingdom of heaven. I am aware that for some Christians my sentiment seems too simple and lofty. But I say, so what? There has to come a time when we decide whether the Good News of the Gospel is true, that “God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.” If it is true, we ought to shout it from the roof tops! If it is false, we out to acknowledge that a fraud has been perpetrated and close up shop. We wouldn’t do that, church. We know the truth.*

*C.S. Lewis put it well when he spoke of the Apostles and early Christians and those who came after leaving their mark on the earth precisely because their minds were occupied with heaven. He says it is a symptom of Christians having largely ceased to think of the other world that they have become so ineffective in bringing about change in this world. I want to see the people of God making changes in our broken world, and if we would have our eyes on heaven, we would do it. I want our neighbors to see joy on our faces. I want the world to see how much we love each other. I want others to know when they look at us that there is good in this world.*

*So I want to remind you that when this world and all that is in it ceases to exist, there will still be those who are more alive than ever before—alive and vibrant and happy because they have survived with their identities in tact in the presence of the One whose very nature is love. There will be laughter and singing and fellowship and peace beyond human imagination, and you and I are invited. The entire Bible climaxes with our invitation. Let us read from Revelation chapter 22 and verse 17: ‘The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And let the one who hears say, “Come!” Let the one who is thirsty come; and let the one who wishes take the free gift of the water of life.’ Three times the invitation is given. The sovereign God of all the universe extends to you his personal invitation.*

*Before you start making excuses for why you cannot come to the celebration, I hope you will permit me to spell out exactly what that invitation means.*

*First of all, this is a COME AS YOU ARE party. Say you haven’t anything to wear. Your hair isn’t fixed, your shoes are worn, your best suit is soiled. It doesn’t matter. You’ll be made new.*

*Say you feel ashamed of yourself. Your face bears the mark of your sins, your shoulders are stooped from needless burdens you’ve carried all your life, your arteries are clogged with bitterness and resentment. That’s okay. He will take those things from you at the door.*

*But what if you have made poor choices in secret, what you if you are hiding skeletons in your closet? It makes no difference. There won’t be anyone there who deserves their invitation. You are invited to COME AS YOU ARE. No one is turned away regardless of what is found in their past.*

*You are invited to a COME AS YOU ARE party. You really don’t believe that, do you? In fact you would prefer that God would add some conditions—especially for other people. No, that is not the case. You will not find rules or regulations on this invitation. It is for all.*

*Here is the second bit of good news, ADMISSION IS FREE. Oh wow! Out of the pure love of the Creator, the debt has been paid. Pure, unadulterated love coming from the Father, evidenced in the life of His Son. But does this mean you’ve been serving on these church committees for nothing? Does it mean that all the hours you’ve given in service won’t be taken into account at all? Yes, that’s right—if you had hoped it would earn God’s favor.*

*I’m so thankful for those of you who are going the extra mile in service to God and your neighbors. This world would be a miserable and lonely place without you. But listen, I have to tell you that it will not help you gain entrance into the celebration. The admission price has already been paid.*

*It is a party to be anticipated. Your good works won’t get you in. It’s free. But there is one more thing to be said. The party is HERE and NOW.*

*Eternal life is our promise, and this means no beginning and no end. Heaven is the present moment. It is any place that God is. You can experience heaven right now.*

*I heard a story about a little fellow whose mother had died. His father was trying hard to be both mom and dad under difficult circumstances. The father had scheduled a picnic for the two of them. The little fellow had never been on a picnic. He was excited—so excited that the night before, he couldn’t sleep. In the dark, quiet house at night, there was the patter of little feet down the hall to the father’s room. The son shook his dad awake. He asks, “What’s the matter?” The little fellow says, “Oh dad, tomorrow is going to be so wonderful. I just can’t sleep, I’m so excited!” The father chuckles and coughs in his sleepy daze, and replies, “Son, it won’t be so wonderful if we don’t get any sleep. Now go back to your bed.” Not too long after, the ritual is repeated. The father, sleeping soundly, suddenly finds himself awake again, the boy’s hand on his shoulder. He asks, “What is it?” And this time, very serious, the boy says, “Dad, I just want to thank you for tomorrow.”*

*My prayer this morning will echo that of the excited little boy. Father, I just want to thank you for tomorrow. We live in the excitement of tomorrow today. Church, that’s how we are able to overcome the obstacles in this life. The excitement for tomorrow is what motivates our work today. The party waiting for us in heaven lives with us in our hearts right now. Don’t you feel it there? If you have truly come to know the life that is given in Christ, you will know that heaven is here. And if you haven’t yet accepted this gift of life, know that it is so close to you now, it’s available for you. It flows through this church, through these people.*

*Let’s close in prayer together. Thank you, father, for tomorrow. Thank you for making us a new creation, for changing our hearts and our lives to look more like you, and to dwell with you in eternity. Amen.*

Bright morning sunlight fills the sanctuary. A few major keys are struck on the piano’s chords. The dozens of people filling the pews bow their heads with their eyes closed. Some of them whisper words quietly. Others sing along to the hymn. They are united by music and light in the solemnity of this Sunday morning. Their souls find rest.
