*raspberries*

My family rolls out of the house and makes the trip across town to grandpa and grandma's for dinner. Tonight my uncle is grilling hotdogs and hamburgers, and grandma makes a jello salad which will be largely untouched, as always. My dad parks our minivan in the driveway, next to my aunt's Honda, and the six of us hop out. No one gets past the front door without a big hug and warm welcome from grandpa and grandma. Grandpa pats my back, and grandma smiles with a shining face. They are happy to see me.

My cousin is here. We spend very little time deciding what we should play together. There's a box of toys left behind at the grandparents house that their kids didn't take with them when they became adults. We can play with these or we can go to the park down the street past the cul-de-sac. Sometimes another girl from the neighborhood will play with us. She has a scooter, and she talks really loud. But we choose the dolls. My cousin has the best collection of doll clothes, doll homes, even doll cars. In the extra bedroom of our grandparent’s home, we sit on the floor and make up stories to act out, until something else happens or it’s time to eat.

The adults in the living room talk about serious things. Leon fills in the family on the latest from his dealings with McDonald’s. The church he has pastored for years, the one that my parents were married in, where all of us grandkids were baptized, has caught the attention of the fast food restaurant industry. He lets everyone know that they have made their final offer to buy the property, and he will accept it. His daughters and their husbands have questions, certainly, and they begin to sort out what all this means together.

The heat of the afternoon has faded, the serious conversation closes, and I make my way outside where the coolness of the evening begins. In the backyard I say hello to my uncle who has the grill smoking by now. He has an extra special bratwurst over the fire, he tells me, but I'm not interested since I know 'special' really means 'spicy' coming from him. My brothers pick up the golf clubs that grandpa has laying around and start hitting golf balls. The neighbor's dogs on the other side of the fence aren't happy about it. For each ball that’s hit, there's a series of barks.

Grandpa comes outside and we look at his plants. This is another ritual often repeated at the house. He walks around the perimeter of the yard and reports on the life and trials of the tomatoes growing up onto their wire structures, and the roses at the back of the yard in their raised beds, and the raspberries, I love the raspberries, growing up onto a fence that Grandpa posted for them. He says the tomatoes are getting eaten by squirrels or some other pest. He says last year he had more raspberries than this year, but he always says that.

The women show up again from inside the house to tell us it's almost time to eat. I help Grandma in the kitchen. She asks me to fill the plastic cups with ice and set out the paper plates. Everyone gathers around and grandpa leads us in prayer. I bow my head and close my hands in front of my face. He gives thanks for our food and our time together. He speaks loud and long for prayer. I peek out from between my fingers and watch as he sways back and forth on his heels, his hands lifted, his eyes closed. His prayers have a rhythm, his phrases turn circles. Up and down. Back and forth. I repeat my "amen" with everyone else and we fill up our plates. The adults sit in the living room and eat off the foldable TV tray tables. Sometimes one of the men shouts at the TV if a referee makes a bad call or something. I eat my hot dog and drink my sweet tea. My brothers talk about a video game. The grandparents ask us about school. On the walls, framed in glass, our own smiling faces look back at us.

For dessert, we go to the garden once more to pick the raspberries and enjoy their sweetness with our ice cream. It's my favorite thing. Grandpa's raspberries are very important to me for this reason. We get a big bowl and take it to the backyard to collect them. Grandpa helps me pick out the best ones. He points out the raspberries that have been eaten up by bugs, and warns me to avoid them. My eyes are trained on the brightest red I can spot within the bush of green leaves. Some raspberries squish in my hands and leave red juice dripping down my arms. We go back inside with our bounty. My mother and my aunt start to scoop a bowl for everyone. The football game on the TV is at halftime and there's a pop singer performing on a stage. No one pays attention to it. We love dessert.

With the sun still up for a few more minutes, my brother and I return to the backyard. He tells me a piece of the serious conversation he heard, “McDonald’s bought our church.” We think this is very exciting and funny, imagining the familiar arches of the ‘M’ replacing the cross in the baptistry. We climb the fence and lift ourselves onto the roof of grandpa’s shed. Sitting with my knees bent to my chest, I look out over the neighborhood cast in an orange evening glow, and silently I enjoy my lonely feeling.

Back inside, the family discusses what game we want to play. We go over what happened last time we played this one, and who is always cheating at that one. Eventually, the decision is made. It’s Catchphrase, a game of charades. We laugh just about the whole time, mostly at Grandma. Everyone forgets everything else that’s going on. My mom frequently wipes at joyful tears on her cheeks.

A storm blew through this afternoon, and we haven’t heard from the grandparents yet. The kids from the neighborhood and I packed into a storm shelter. Their pets whined at our feet knowing something was wrong. Several pensive, sweaty moments went by, then the adults finally brought us out. I wanted to be relieved, but the uncertainty in their faces kept the feeling away.

I step outside, first noticing the stillness, taking in the blackened sky. In the violent winds, everything has shifted. I pick up small pieces of paper trash littering our yard that have been carried far and wide. There’s a family photo laying here, someone else’s family. I keep it in the hope that it could one day be returned.

Everyone else is active and anxious, looking up at the sky or staring down at their phone trying to will it to send a call. No one is able to get through to grandpa’s cell phone, and by now, based on the footage scrolling on the tv, we know that their home is near severely impacted areas. The dust in the sky is starting to settle, and a familiar orange red hue replaces the blackness. Cars line our street, not moving. No one is able to make progress into the affected neighborhoods for all the debris in the way. But despite this, my dad and brothers load up the truck with some tools, feeling desperate to locate the family and attempt whatever rescue is needed. I watch them pull out of the neighborhood, and send a short prayer ahead of them. “*God, please*.”

Facing the storm is not the hard part. Living in Moore, tornadoes come as no surprise. We’ve seen plenty. It’s almost a game to us to test how long we can stand to watch them form over our heads before we seek shelter. Personally, I hate this game. I take comfort in my knowledge from science class where we recently discussed exactly what it is and why it happens. The warm air meets the cold air, and they get mixed up in the sky as they pass each other on the plain. The difficult part is afterwards, seeing the wreckage left behind and deciding if it’s worth recovering. I already know the bowling lanes have been taken out in this storm, and the movie theater. I wonder if those will be gone forever. But we know why it happens, we see it often enough. It’s not like us to stumble through the rubble seeking answers. The solemn, metaphysical questions that come to mind when we see the homes of families we love collapsed into heaps never escape from the mouths of people from Moore. We get a close enough look at the clouds to know how deeply impersonal they are.

Hours later in the dark of night, the rescue group returns. Without our phones able to connect, this is my mother and I’s first sign of relief. They tell us they were able to get to the grandparents, and they are all right. The information is slowly revealed as they reel from the shock. Their house was hit, but it’s still standing. Their neighbors were not so fortunate.

The next day we return, all of us this time. We’re a cleaning crew now that the rescue is done. It is a little easier to maneuver through the strewn streets. We finally reach the house and realize how close they were to losing it to the twisting cloud. It’s one of four that are still intact on this street. Everywhere I look I see the insides of the neighbor’s houses. But unlike the day before, the sun is brightly shining, and several other cleaning crews slowly pick at the surrounding piles.

Inside the house, it is dustier than I’ve ever seen it before. The windows facing the street have attracted piles of dust, and the windows at the back are piles of glass on the floor. Before I begin to sweep, I look out over the street, and catch a glimpse of grandpa. He’s standing there in the driveway with a woman, his neighbor. She’s balancing a small box between her arms while wiping away the tears on her face. Grandpa listens to her speak, nods patiently, gives her all his attention. I can sense from this distance the comfort he gives. Behind them, piles of lumber that used to be the roof of the house stick out in every direction.

Grandpa, with his own house in disarray, spends the day with the neighbors who have lost more. And that makes him supernatural to me.

When he talks about the tornado, he’ll say, “Oh, it was louder than anything. I got grandma in the hallway with the mattress around us. She sang the hymns and I prayed. It was terrible, terrible.” And then he’ll be silent for a few minutes.

I came up to the church this afternoon. My brother needed something from the house that he and I are sharing, so I’m just making the drop off. He’s working in this church now, the church that grandpa built years ago after McDonald’s gave him a million dollars for the old one. He has since retired. Now the small congregation is cared for by a new pastor, a very pleasant man with a sweet family. My brother is working with the youth; he’s basically building up a youth group from nothing. I’m happy for him. He’s growing to be like grandpa. And amidst all the turbulence of our adolescence, he has managed to keep his faith. I can’t say the same for me.

In the middle of the week, the church is silent and unused. I am walking the halls alone, taking advantage of the quiet moments to do some wistful thinking, my favorite thing to do. My memory machine is almost short-circuiting. There is so much within this building that has been so important in my life, yet after a stretch of a few short years, it’s only a building again.

In the restroom, a pleasant memory comes into view. I’m standing in front of a full length mirror, at half the height I am now, as one of the dear women of the church is making final adjustments to my gorgeous Christmas dress. She has worked silky royal blue fabric into the sweetest shape, and embellished it with gold ribbon. Overlaying the skirt of the dress is a netted sheer with gold stars all over it. It’s my one of a kind dress; she made it just for me. I bop up and down with excitement on the stool she asked me to step on. The memory fades. I look at myself in the same mirror, and my existence feels flat in comparison.

Down the hall is a grand office for the pastor. He’s gone out this afternoon, so the door is locked. No matter, I remember it so well. I remember as a child leaving my Sunday school classroom to come in here and stretch out on the couch. I was only permitted the rest because I wasn’t feeling well that day, but I felt extra special to be there with grandpa as he prepared for the sermon. From where I laid, I can still see him frowning down at a stack of paper, his glasses perched at the tip of his nose. The window behind him allowed the sunlight to spill over his shoulders. His very important books darken the bookshelves around him. I had never seen grandpa at work before.

I turn from the door. That memory hurt quite a bit. I’m not sure why it made me sad.

Around the corner from here is the fellowship hall, the name church people use for a multi-purpose room. Really, it’s just where we eat. I step inside the long rectangular room and the smell takes me back to the potlucks and parties of my youth. I wonder how many slices of generic cake with electric blue icing I have stuffed myself with in here.

I take the choir entrance into the sanctuary. It’s a few steps up a dark stairwell before a small door that opens onto the stage. I look out over the empty rows of pews. This room is almost too much, too full of moments, and I already feel my emotions rolling in like waves about to break the threshold. My mind grips onto the most recent ones. It’s my brother and I sharing sheet music, practicing worship songs. Since he started working here, he’s asked me a few times to play music with him for the service. Standing here now that feeling returns, the sneaky insincerity I use as a costume to perform for church people. I’m not sure when it happened, I grew up singing at church on this very stage and many others, but somewhere, somehow I lost my sincerity, my conviction in the music. I know I can’t keep singing and feeling this way. It feels awful.

I’ve been cutting ties between myself and the church for a while. I mean, my whole life was in it, but I don’t care for it the same way, and it doesn’t seem to notice as we drift apart.

My family noticed my drifting. They aren’t letting me go as easily, and I’ve been angry because of it. I’ve been angry at so much. I turn a lot of things sour, like this afternoon, when all I had to do was drop by to see my brother but instead I ghost the halls, recalling visions of my childhood, inviting nostalgia to somberly dance with me.

The nightly build up of traffic between Oklahoma City and Moore has put me behind several minutes for dinner. I have plans with the grandparents for my traditional birthday meal. They always let me pick the place, but they like to eat rather early. I couldn’t get away from my homework quickly enough to get ahead of the rush. I just know they are already sitting there at the restaurant, not ordering anything because of course they’ll wait on me. I wish they would enjoy an appetizer through my tardiness at least. Not likely.

My journey finally completed, I pull into the parking lot. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, I see them and hurry to the table.

“Sorry, hi! Sorry, I forgot the traffic would be so bad!”

Grandpa gets up from the table to give me a hug. He says, “Well there she is, happy birthday! Have a seat, have a seat.”

I bend down to grandma’s chair to give her a squeeze. Her walker is parked next to the table with her purse hung up on the handle. She pats my back, saying “Happy birthday, Jana, happy birthday.” She beams a smile at me as I pull back and take my seat.

“I hope I didn’t keep you guys waiting too long.” I notice the table is empty, just like I anticipated.

He says, “No, no we don’t mind it.” And pulling from a pocket inside his coat, he presents a card. It’s got my name in cursive on the envelope. The same thing for every one of my birthdays. I know there will be a crisp twenty dollar bill within it. I smile and accept the  gift.

He sits back and looks at me. “Now tell us, how’s Jana? How’s the birthday girl?”

I blow out my breath and swing my eyes up to the ceiling, as if up there are floating all the things I’ve gotten myself into. “You know, I’m just hanging in there. I got my midterms back today. So my first grades are in for the semester.”

Grandma says, “Oh my,” and gives a nervous face. She asks, “Did you do okay?”

“Yep, I think so. Most of them are A’s, one B. But I’m not too worried.”

She nods, “That’s good, Jana. Good for you.”

Grandpa says, “We knew she was a smart one. She studies those books. I can’t even read ‘em.”

Grandma and I  laugh together at grandpa being silly.

A waiter comes by to take our order. Eventually our food arrives, hot and steamy. They have a lot of questions for me, and they love hearing anything I tell them. Without any direction, he makes a few adjustments for her to help with her plate. I realize how they’re getting old. For every year we meet on my birthday, there’s a longer list of things she can’t do anymore.

*outro*

The news came from my cousin, my aunt’s only child, my mother’s only sister. She said she wasn’t sure if anyone had told us, but we should know, our grandmother is in her last days.

I find myself in my grandparent's home with all the familiar things around. This home was specifically chosen to allow her movement through it while pushing a walker or being pushed in a wheelchair. There is a lift over the bed which we strap her into at night to raise her from the wheelchair and up onto the bed. She makes no objections, she appreciates the help in her way with a faint smile.

I think she likes it when I'm here at night to go through this routine. She brightens to talk to me, though she can't find any words to say. I'm afraid she gets embarrassed when I help her into a diaper, so we both stay quiet for that part. Then I open the drawer where her pajamas are neatly folded, that's thanks to grandpa, or perhaps my aunt, and ask her to choose which pair she'd like to wear, attempting to sound cheerful. She chooses the pink ones. Grandpa takes one pant leg and I take the other, and together we clothe her body to keep her warm and secure for another night's rest. Last, she brushes her teeth, that's the only part of the routine she can do on her own.

Grandpa oversees all this, he knows the routine well. He makes sure she has all that she needs, and he's extra careful about the straps of the lift that go around her. He warns me that the straps can get tangled and make her uncomfortable. Other than a few instructions to me or to grandma, he stays quiet.

Now, she is no longer getting out of bed. Hospice care has brought in a hospital bed and placed it in the living room. It's small but its presence is felt throughout the house, casting a dark gloom, shifting and unsettling.

She’s sleeping. I wanted to spend the whole day by her side, but how quickly the day passes. She’s shaking. It’s her hands and feet and mouth that give away the clues as to what disease is overcoming her, taking her strength. I brought a guitar to pluck out a few old hymns. Grandpa sang with me. His deep baritone voice and my unpracticed alto set the music in motion, keeping the time and the rhythm since we know the songs by heart. My guitar did not glide like our voices, it interrupted them, and I chuckled it off. I played it for grandma, and it was okay, and grandpa knew it was sincere.

My grandfather’s strength only grows. I think loving her and caring for her gives him energy. He’ll hold her hand and look into her eyes, the only part of her that responds, and say, “I love you.” He repeats this to her often. I am so struck by how remarkable a person he is. He never seems to reach the end of his rope. He is patient and kind. He is solemn and wise. He considers her first in all things. His care may be matter-of-fact at times, and he may be a little rough around the edges, but he is always solid. He is always present. He is not soft, his strength carries each of us through.

She slips away from us, deeper into the disease until it will want more of her than she has to give.

Grandpa and I take a walk through his small garden. We note the colorful zinnias, always an important member of the garden for their roots in grandma’s family, the Zinns. They look a little scorched to me along the concrete path. Then there are the enormous, gorgeous peonies. The best flower grandpa has grown in a few years, with the help of the dirt and sun, and the ants to open them up. I crouch down on my knees to sniff their perfume. Grandpa continues the tour, and we come to a magnolia tree he inherited from the previous owners. He tells me he can’t understand how much water this tree needs, and shows me how the leaves have been slipping away. He asks me to take note of the buds, not opening up yet. I encourage him and share my excitement for the growth of the tree, how it will look through the seasons.

Once we’ve been through the garden, grandpa leads us to his study, a place untouched since 2009 with a layer of dust to prove it. There’s a plastic shell of a computer on the desk. There are theology books and bibles filling the shelves. File cabinets take a corner of the room. Grandpa comments on the numerous plaques on the wall, which I realize I have never taken notice of before. They are monuments to my grandpa’s goodness, and this is the one time he has uttered a word about them. They say things like, “faithful minister of 40 years,” and, “Brother Sutterfield - Shepherd to his Flock.” I look at each one as grandpa moves about the room, and I wonder what else I must have missed about him. He pulls open a file drawer to show me the neat organization of all his years of preaching in sermon notes. With a chuckle, he says, “I don’t know why I keep them, they just sit here, like me.” I ask if I can borrow them, and he’s happy to hand them off.

I have only grown more curious about the person that my grandpa is, so I drop by his house often. It seems like he always has something to show me, or a new story to tell me. He will remember something from growing up, or remember the name of a person who used to attend his church. He has the details of someone’s latest surgery or hospitalization. And the news, yes, he shares something of interest he saw on the news. As I listen, I think how lucky I am.

Reaching the end of the tour, grandpa turns to a photo framed on the wall. He says, “This must have been when I retired.” It is a photo of Leon and Janis in the sanctuary of the church that grandpa built. He is in his gray suit with a red tie, and she has green flowers on her black dress. They stand together, his arm around her. I smile at the faces I love smiling at me. He continues, “I like this picture. We look like us.”

*refrain*

Between grandpa’s life and mine, there is more than biology or bloodline. There is everything that can be known in this life. There is the reality of death. And within it, I’d say there’s an infinity of experience. Examining grandpa’s life in search of the source of its meaning has brought me to this understanding: a family is a pattern which each individual is thrown into.

Each member in my family shares a belief in the God of the Bible. I haven’t met a cousin or aunt who would declare an objection to this. As we live and move and breathe, we believe in a purpose that has been shown to us through the life of Jesus Christ. In each soul that has a biological connection to mine, I find reverence for the perfect ideal in all things, past, present and future, things of the mind and of the body and of human governance, and this ideal is better stated as God. God is perfecting, moving, changing around us, in us and through us. God is our desire to align ourselves to the perfection of all things. Perfection: “the quality of being free;” the transformation of all things to be made free.

What a wonder it is to find that each life who is connected to mine by blood should share this confidence in the existence of God. Each generation carries this belief as faithfully as those before. Yet I thought I stood in contrast to this. I thought that I got smarter than my family because I knew a world they didn't know. I called this the “real” world, the world where people were honest about their doubts, and in fact, happy to be free of faith. I thought I truly belonged in that world, writing those stories. I felt that I possessed a sophistication; I had nothing of the sort. The charm of this other world wore off when I saw its ugliness laid bare. I saw its lies that I had traded for truth. That’s when I ran back home. This is the pattern, I see it repeated. It is not unique to me, it is necessary. I see it in grandpa’s life. There is a moment of departure from the old way, the way that he must have been convinced was the old way that wouldn’t operate in the world he walked in. Then there is a reconciliation with reality, or truth, or nature. And having his wits about him, he sees that the way forward is to change, to return.

I see our lives woven into the same fabric, and after studying the lines in mine, I see the same motifs emerge in his. And zooming out further to take in the piece as a whole, I see an image emerge from his life, my mother’s and father’s, my brothers’, my own. Each of us returns and returns to an organizing truth which accounts for the beauty in our tapestry. I see that this truth is God. I feel mightily privileged to belong to a pattern of truth and of beauty. I feel lucky to belong to a people that have a desire for my personal discovery of truth.

I am realizing my adult mind. I used to be annoyed by restrictions of any kind. I used to promote an ideal of destruction. It occurs to me that an individual’s development requires that every boundary should be pushed. I understand myself better with that realization. I understand my grandpa better, my parents better. I have come out of my boundary-pushing thinking. I have begun to look around and see more than myself reflected back at me. I have begun to see why the things of God are so important to my family, to every person who can draw a line from their lineage to mine. This book is my declaration of the goodness, mercy, hope and truth I see around me now that I am looking.

I noticed this pattern in my family while I was still young. I wrestled with it. I thought it was not for me, and I let this thought isolate me. Family, I come back into the fold with renewed faith. It has been the pleasure of my life to create the book that would tell you exactly that.

The last word belongs to grandpa. I asked him what was the most important principle that he lived by. His answer: “Be honest and love everybody. My philosophy in pastoring, from the beginning to the end, I wasn't smart enough to deal with theology, but to love the people, I could do that.”
