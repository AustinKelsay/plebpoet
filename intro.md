*dedication*

Grandpa,

You are often in my thoughts. You are a marvel and somewhat of a mystery to me. Your dedication, sacrifice, and commitment to all that is good and true, pure and holy, marks you as the best person, the most exemplary and virtuous man, that I have known. I must express my gratitude for your pursuit of godliness because it has saved my life.

Your granddaughter

*introduction*

In the first quarter of my life, I became fascinated by the feeling of control I could access when I processed my feelings and dreams and turned them into language. This is a trait I believe must have come from my grandparents in part. My grandmother gave the rules of language the respect they deserve and instilled in me a love for those rules (the only rules I love), and my grandfather used language as his tool to bring messages down from heaven and interpret meaning out of life. For that alone, they have my living devotion.

When I was 25, a virus entered the global stage, an unknown thing on an unknown mission. The power that this virus possessed and the control we humans thought we had could not exist in the same place. As a result, the world shifted, the world I had only just begun to understand. This world shift affected everyone I know in impossibly dissimilar ways, so complex, unrelated and dependent upon circumstance that if I were to try to untangle the web of this one event’s meaning, I’d have an infinity to decipher. Whatever it was, whatever it means, it has become a catalyst for the existence of this book.

In this book, I am not going to decipher infinity. I am going to tell you about my grandpa. I am going to tell the story of my grandpa’s life, his faith, and its impact on my life. If in the telling of my grandpa, I happen to arrive at a linguistic equation for deciphering infinity, that would make this book something worth reading, wouldn’t it?
